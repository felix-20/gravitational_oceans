surfing the gravitational waves

## setup

we provide a `requirements.txt` file for you to install the required dependencies.
It is highly recommended to install them in a virtual environment, i.e. [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
Once all dependencies are installed you can start surfing.

The source code for our networks and other approaches can be found in the `./src` directory.
As this project is not (yet) a pip package, you might need to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, to be able to import functions from other directories in `./src`
For linux, this could look like this:

```terminal
export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_src_folder>
```

*Note*: all the data you generate or models you train will be saved in folders in your cwd.

**Have fun surfing!**
